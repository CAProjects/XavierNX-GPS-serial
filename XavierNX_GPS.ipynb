    "# Wiring and testing\n",
    "Wiring the GPS breakout board to the Xavier NX is very similar to the Raspberry Pi as it has the same GPIO so the same wiring can be use. 1 different point to note is that the GPIO is rotates 180 degreess in relation to the raspberry pi.\n",

    "# Testing for data\n",
    "Once everything is wired up if you check the serial port using the fllowing command in the terminal `sudo cat /dev/ttyTHS0` you will not get inny data from the GPS board and this is because the baud rate is not correct. The default baudrate is 11500, however, the Adafruit GPS operates on 9600. there is a simple fix to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the terminal use the following command to set the baudrate  `stty -F /dev/ttyTHS0 9600` then to check that the baudrate has changed  simply type the command without the 9600 at the end and you shoulf get something like this\n",
